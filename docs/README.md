# Spring Boot Clean Architecture WebFlux API

This repository contains a clean architecture implementation of a web API using Spring Boot and WebFlux. Clean architecture is a software design pattern that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability by organizing code into distinct layers with clear dependencies and responsibilities. This project aims to provide a well-structured foundation for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (Java 17 or higher)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jugurta/cleanarchitecture.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cleanarchitecture
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

The application should now be up and running locally.

## Project Structure

The project follows the clean architecture principles, which means it's organized into distinct layers:

- **Presentation**: Contains the web controllers and request/response models.
- **Domain**: Contains the core domain entities and business rules.
- **Infrastructure**: Handles database access and data storage.

This separation of concerns makes the application easy to maintain and test.

## Usage

To interact with the API, you can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/).

Example API endpoints:


- `POST /person`: Create a new person.
- `GET /person/{id}`: Retrieve a person by ID.

Ensure to check the API documentation and the available endpoints in the project source code.

## Features

- Clean architecture for maintainability and scalability.
- Reactive programming with Spring WebFlux.
- Dockerized application for easy deployment.
- API endpoints for user management.

## Technologies Used
